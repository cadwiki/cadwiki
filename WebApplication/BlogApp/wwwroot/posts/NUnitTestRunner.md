# NUnitTestRunner  
I made a new addition to the CadDevTools package.  
The NUnitTestRunner is a package that let's me run automated tests within AutoCAD's appdomain.  
This package has helped increase my code quality and I wanted to share incase others find it useful.  
I will post more details next week.
